## restriction

I'm not familiar with Android Studio, so could anyone tell me about the following restrictions?

- use only C++ source
  - How to compile `base64.ll` in [CMakeLits.txt](app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt).
- support only C++ api
  - How to set the path to the [com.herumi.mcl](app/src/main/cpp/mcl/ffi/java/com).
